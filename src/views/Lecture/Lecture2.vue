                    In the era of large language models (LLMs), agents play an essential role in leveraging AI's power
                    to foster innovation and improve efficiency across various industries. LLM-based agents, in
                    particular, hold the promise of achieving human-level software development. These agents not only
                    comprehend and generate natural language but also continuously refine their software development
                    skills through extensive interactions with vast codebases and development environments. This lecture
                    will cover several key topics: an introduction to the concept of agents, a detailed exploration of
                    the LLM-based agent framework, and an examination of their applications in software development,
                    which includes tasks such as code generation and debugging.
