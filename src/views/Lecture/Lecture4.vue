                    The impressive performance of LLMs is largely due to their extensive training datasets. However, in
                    fields where public data is scarce, the efficacy of general large models often diminishes. To
                    address this, we explored the application of LLMs to domain-specific problems in data-scarce fields,
                    taking analog circuit design as a case study. Analog circuit design relies heavily on domain
                    expertise, which is typically not available on the internet. We investigated two different technical
                    strategies to harness LLMs for automated analog circuit design: training a domain-specific LLM and
                    enhancing a general LLM with a domain-specific knowledge base. Compared to conventional methods,
                    both approaches achieve design efficiency improvements dozens of times.
